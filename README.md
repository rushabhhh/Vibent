# 🌐 Team MetaVibe Presents : VIBENT 
**A Decentralized Social (DeSoc) Platform for Authentic Skills & Connections**  

## 🚀 Overview  
Today’s social and professional platforms (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) are filled with **fake credentials, inflated achievements, and shallow engagement**. Anyone can post ‘I won XYZ hackathon’ on LinkedIn — but how do you know it’s real?”
Certificates can be faked, edited, or borrowed from a friend. Achievements are inflated, credentials unverifiable. Recruiters, communities, and networks are left guessing.

We’re solving this with **Proof of Talent** and **Proof of Vibe**, two on-chain primitives for the future of decentralized society:  

- 🎓 **Proof of Talent** – Verifiable, soulbound credentials (certificates, achievements, badges) tied to user wallets. No more fake LinkedIn claims.  
- ✨ **Proof of Vibe** – An AI-enhanced reputation score capturing authenticity, creativity, and community trust, stored as a dynamic soulbound NFT.  

Together, they form a **decentralized identity layer for skills + vibes**, enabling a trusted, portable reputation across Web3 and beyond.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Soulbound Credentials (Proof of Talent)**  
  - Universities, hackathons, DAOs, or platforms issue certificates directly on-chain.  
  - Credentials are **non-transferable NFTs**, stored in the user’s wallet forever.  
  - Metadata (certs, proofs) stored securely on **BNB Greenfield**.  

- **Reputation Graph (Proof of Vibe)**  
  - AI + on-chain activity measure authenticity and creativity.  
  - Community-driven endorsements → verifiable “social trust” score.  
  - Score represented as a **soulbound NFT**.  

- **Portable Social Graph**  
  - Credentials and vibe move with you across apps, not siloed in one platform.  

- **Opportunities & Discovery**  
  - Recruiters, DAOs, and collaborators filter candidates by verified skills + vibe.  
  - Mentors/experts share short-form content and earn tokens for impact.

## 📦 Architecture
1. **Issuer (Hackathon, University, Company)** → issues credentials as SBT.  
2. **User (Learner, Professional, Creator)** → stores credentials & vibe NFT in wallet.  
3. **Verifier (Recruiter, DAO, Org)** → checks authenticity instantly on-chain.  
4. **Community Layer** → vibe scores, endorsements, content.
